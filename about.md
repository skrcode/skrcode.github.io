My name is Victor, after graduating from Télécom SudParis I started to work as a Developer/Consultant. I discovered the Machine Learning field in February 2016 and since I didn't stop to learn about it. I've followed numerous courses online. Be it Mooc, Courses (Materials freely available) from top Universities or books. I recently quit my job and want to focus on learning more and more about Machine Learning and especially Deep Learning. I've started creating this blog to share the experiences that I'm acquiring in my path to becoming (I hope) a Ph.D. student.

### More Information
I'm currently available and will be delighted to start a Master 2 in the field of Machine Learning to then start a Ph.D. I listed here some of the materials I used to deepen my knowledge about ML:

Courses:
- Certification Coursera [CS229: Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/P6YMNE6EN3HM "Certification ML")
- Certification Coursera [CS228: Probabilistic Graphical Models 1](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/ALATNRU8JTFX "Certification PGM 1")
- Certification Coursera [CS228: Probabilistic Graphical Models 2](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/ZZ65ZDATAY3F "Certification PGM 2")
- Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889 "Certification AIND") - In Progress (I finished all the **available** assignments so far)
- Stanford CS231n: CNN for Visual Recognition - Here are my [solutions to the assignments](https://github.com/Twice22/CS231n-solutions "My solutions")
- Stanford CS224n: Deep Learning for NLP - Here are my [solutions to the assignments](https://github.com/Twice22/CS224n-solutions "My solutions")

Books that I read:
- Python Machine Learning - [Here](https://github.com/Twice22/PythonMachineLearning) are the code that I rewrote with comments.
- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning - Bishop
- Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach 3rd edition - Stuart Russel, Peter Norvig
- Deep Learning - Yoshua Bengio, Ian Goodfellow, Aaron Courville
- lots of research papers and blog articles

Future courses that I will take before September:
- Accelerated C++ - [FINISHED](https://github.com/Twice22/acceleratedcpp "Accelerated C++") -
- Reinforcement Learning - [FINISHED](https://twice22.github.io/reinforcement-learning/) - I will study Reinforcement Learning soon using both [David Silver Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0) and [Gerogia Tech Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/reinforcement-learning--ud600)
- The Go Programming Language [IN PROGRESS](https://github.com/Twice22/GoTutorials)
- I will also study convex optimization problems in greater depth using this [book](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf)
