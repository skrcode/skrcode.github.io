Recursive react
components enable the code to be clean, maintainble, extensible and readable.
Recursion reduces seemingly complex problems to simpler ones.
The tutorial explains recursion in React from the fundamentals along with a simple example in addition to a complex one being introduced towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A tutorial on how to use recursion in React components.

Highest Public LB score - 0.29 (Top 50) for a published kernel in the contest. Uses Simple Feature Engineering like Punctuation,Stop Words,Glove Sentence vectors. 
In addition, it creates stack features from simple Features such as tfidf and count vectors for words and chars. Multinomial naive bayes(mnb) is then applied with the following combination - tfidf+words+mnb,tfidf+chars+mnb,count+words+mnb,count+chars+mnb. 
Conv Nets on keras texttosequence, NNs on glove sentence vectors and Fast Text are also used as stack features.
